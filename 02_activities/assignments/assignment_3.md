# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
        
Visualization 1: Complaint Customer Dashboard by Putra Gema Nusa
The Complaint Customer Dashboard is moderately accessible, but improvements are needed. Its design effectively highlights key data points like "Total Complaints" and "Timely Responses." However, the heavy reliance on shades of red and small text size for certain sections reduces accessibility for users with visual impairments, particularly those who are colorblind. Pie charts, as used in "Complaint by Media" and "Timely Responses," are less effective for visual comparisons than bar charts or other methods that better show proportions.
The dashboard lacks information about the data sources, methodology, or tools used to create the visualizations, which hinders its reproducibility. Including a reference to the data source and explanation of how the analysis was conducted would enable others to replicate the process and validate the findings.
In terms of equity, the dashboard presents aggregate data without providing demographic insights, such as complaints by age, gender, or location (beyond the map). This limits its ability to uncover patterns that could address inequities, such as regions or groups experiencing disproportionately high complaints or slower responses.

Visualization 2: MyWorld2030 Survey - Q2 by Demographic Group
The MyWorld2030 visualization effectively highlights demographic trends across Sustainable Development Goals but is visually overwhelming. The diverse color palette and complex connections between demographic categories create challenges for accessibility, particularly for users with cognitive or visual impairments. While the icons representing goals are helpful, the overlapping lines require more clarification, which could confuse viewers.
The visualization does not include information about the source of the data or the methodology used, reducing its reproducibility. Providing these details would ensure that others can replicate or validate the analysis. Additionally, some lines and trends are difficult to interpret without annotations or tooltips explaining their significance.
In terms of equity, the visualization attempts to address disparities by highlighting demographic groups like gender, age, and disability. However, its complexity might obscure critical patterns, especially for non-technical audiences. Simplifying the presentation or breaking it into smaller, focused visualizations could make it more equitable and easier to interpret.

    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?  
Visualization 1: Complaint Customer Dashboard by Putra Gema Nusa
Use a colorblind-friendly palette and replace pie charts with bar charts for improved readability.
Increase text size and add data labels to provide more clarity.
Include a data source and brief description of the methodology to enhance reproducibility.
Add demographic breakdowns to provide equitable insights and identify disparities.

Visualization 2: MyWorld2030 Survey - Q2 by Demographic Group
Simplify the design by reducing overlapping lines or dividing the visualization into smaller, focused charts.
Use interactive tooltips in digital versions to provide explanations of trends.
Include a clear methodology and data source for transparency and reproducibility.
Add annotations or labels to guide viewers through complex insights, especially for critical trends in equity-related demographics.

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization.
